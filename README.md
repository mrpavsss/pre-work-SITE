* [n] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [n] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [n] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [n] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [none] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I did not use any outside resources to help finish this submission. All completed work was done with 
 the aid of the instructions/tutorial.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[It was difficult for me in implement some of the optional features listed above. I was able to 
 accomplish the first two but do not have not enough experience to insert images and audio files for 
 the buttons and sounds. I was able to learn about different fonts, colors, curvatures, and audio 
 frequencies by manually changing them to my liking.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would stll like to know if it is possible for a website to record how long a user kept the site 
 open. While the site was still open, can it also record if the user accessed a different site? If so,
 record the URL, time on that site, and number of visits? I would also like to learn to run multiple 
 video/audio plugins simultaneously from different tabs and from the same site.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Given more time, I would learn how to add images to the buttons, change the duration of each sound 
 and add certain audio tracks to each game button rather than just audio frequences. I would add 
 "Start" and "Stop" audio tracks for the buttons respectively when clicked. I would also like to add a
 recording of how long the user took to enter each pattern. I would add audio message appropriate to 
 each ending of the game.]
